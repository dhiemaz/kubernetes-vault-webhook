# Vault WebHook

Kubernetes Mutation WebHook that adds an in memory volume to all containers and a init container that grabs secrets from vault and dumps the secrets on a file within the in memory volume.

## Notes
This is a brand new project and although its sort of working.  Its not ready to be used.  As I get working probably I will document and update the readme.
